# BlackJack

This is a beginner attempt at trying to program an interactive Blackjack game that only uses (while, if, elif, else).
  I would love to take advantage of classes and higher level coding, but I want to make sure that I fully understand
    the basics of coding before jumping into the next level.
This is an incomplete code and I will update it as often as I can. Im very new to programming, so I may not
  notice that I've added a mistake, or omitted important syntax.
Any advice/tips are completely welcomed while I attempt to write/test my very first project.

The "Deck List" was limited to only a few cards so I could test specific parameters....... Just in case anyone 
  was confused about the length of the Deck List.

*********IGNORE LINE ("DEF PLAYER_CHOICE") AND ALL FOLLOWING LINES*********
